I'll help you migrate your project from Replit Agent to the Replit environment. This migration is essential for proper Replit compatibility, safety, and security practices. Let me first check the current project structure and the progress tracker to understand what needs to be done.


Opened .local/state/replit/agent/progress_tracker.md
I'll help migrate your project from Replit Agent to the standard Replit environment. This migration is essential for proper Replit compatibility, security, and to ensure your project runs smoothly with all the platform's features.

Let me start by examining your project structure and the progress tracker file to understand what needs to be done.


Opened .local/state/replit/agent/progress_tracker.md
Opened home directory

Opened package.json
I can see the migration is already partially in progress. The project appears to be a full-stack application with React frontend, Express backend, and uses PostgreSQL database. I notice the workflow is failing because tsx is not found, which is needed to run the TypeScript server.

Let me check what packages are currently installed and then complete the migration:


Installed dependencies

Agent ran into an error
Good! The packages are now installed. Let me restart the workflow to see if the application can now start properly:


Restarted Start application
Great! The application is now running on port 5000, but it's having trouble connecting to the database. This is a common issue when migrating to Replit. Let me create the database and update the progress tracker:


Created PostgreSQL database
Now I need to restart the workflow so it picks up the new database environment variables:


Restarted Start application
Perfect! The database connection is now working, but the application needs its database tables to be created. Let me check if there's a database migration or seed script and run it:


Opened drizzle.config.ts

Opened shared/schema.ts

Executed npm run db:push
Excellent! The database schema has been successfully applied. Let me now restart the workflow to see if everything is working properly:


Restarted Start application
Perfect! The application is now running successfully. I can see the database has been seeded with 118 patriarchs data and the server is running on port 5000. Now let me verify that the project is working properly using the feedback tool and then update the progress tracker:
